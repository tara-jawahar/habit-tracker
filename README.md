Habit Tracker
========================
My project is a habit tracker that takes in user input and uses it to predict what the next step the user should take in order to implement this habit. The modules I installed in order to run my program were matplotlib and numpy. Both of these combined plot the points and the lines on the graph. Additionally, I imported the csv module to store my data, the math module to perform mathematical operations, and the pickle file to read and write my general data as a dictionary.
